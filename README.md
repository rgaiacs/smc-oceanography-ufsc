SageMath Could Research Experiment with Oceanography at UFSC
============================================================

On [Jupyter Workshop](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/programme/),
Mark Quinn, from the [University of Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), UK,
presented "Using SageMathCloud for teaching undergraduate physics".
At the same workshop,
[Mike Croucher](https://github.com/mikecroucher/),
also from the University of Sheffield,
mentioned the ["Using Jupyter Notebook in Undergraduate teaching" Case Studie](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/bms/teaching/stories/bms353).

Based on conversations during the [SciPy Latin America 2016](scipyla.org/conf/2016/),
hosted at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil,
there was a hole to be fill with computation training
for the Oceanography department who could achieve better
results using SageMath Could.
